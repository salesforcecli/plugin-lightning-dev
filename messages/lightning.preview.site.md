# summary

Preview an Experience Builder site locally and in real-time, without deploying it.

# description

Enable Local Dev to see local changes to your site in a real-time preview that you don't have to deploy or manually refresh. To let you quickly iterate on your Lightning web components (LWCs) and pages, your site preview automatically refreshes when Local Dev detects source code changes.

When you edit these local files with Local Dev enabled, your org automatically reflects these changes.

- Basic HTML and CSS edits to LWCs
- JavaScript changes to LWCs that don't affect the component's public API
- Importing new custom LWCs
- Importing another instance of an existing LWC

To apply any other local changes not listed above, you must deploy them to your org using the `sf project deploy start` command. Then republish your site and restart the server for the Local Dev experience.

For more considerations and limitations, see the Lightning Web Components Developer Guide.
